Focus Models
---

Three focus model layouts for drawing tree graphs:
 - vertex-focused
 - edge-focused
 - axis-focused (two versions)
plus another layout, for monochromatic rays.

In each case, the relevant object (vertex, edge or axis) is the element around
which the rest of the graph is drawn.

Live version is at https://dalling1.github.io/focusmodels/.
